First up: Thanks for being willing to look.

To get going:
- Create a database with Neon ( https://neon.tech/ ) or Vercel (who use Neon as a backend)
- cd in to apps/cms
- Create a file called .env with the following:

--- .env ---
  PAYLOAD_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL="http://localhost:3000/"
  PAYLOAD_SECRET="1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrst"
  DATABASE_URI=YOUR PG DATABASE CONNECTION STRING GOES HERE
  GOOGLE_ID="fakeyfake"
  GOOGLE_SECRET="fakeysecret"
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL="http://localhost:3000/"
--- END ---

The setup is complete.

To reproduce the issue, run:
pnpm payload migrate:create initial

On success, this should create a migration for the initial database state. At the time of requesting
help, the error message was:

Error: Error creating migration: Package subpath './api' is not defined by "exports" in \repos\incrediblysketchy\node_modules\.pnpm\node_modules\drizzle-kit\package.json
    at migrate (\repos\incrediblysketchy\node_modules\.pnpm\payload@3.0.0-beta.100_graphql@16.9.0_monaco-editor@0.51.0_react-dom@19.0.0-rc-06d0b89e-20240_bush5iwf72wa2mz3zarej64lzq\node_modules\payload\src\bin\migrate.ts:92:15)

This seems to indicate an issue with the pg or drizzle-kit versions being too old. It's the version from
apps/website. While I'm happy to update the version under apps/website, it doesn't actually tell me
what the issue is, and how to go about fixing it. That's what I actually want to know, for the future.
